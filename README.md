The Terminal Hacking Game is a Windows Form version of the mini-game found in many of the Fallout games. The idea is to guess the password for a computer system by selecting possible passwords from a list and seeing how many characters match in the correct position. 
The project required two parts:

1. A game created in Windows Forms with C#.
2. To make use of a MS Access DB with the game to allow for the words used to be drawn from a large list. 

In this repository are some of the key methods and classes used in the game. Some sections are commented out because they are improved versions of other code. For example I had to design and create two algorithms which then had to be improved.
